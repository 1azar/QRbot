# QRbot (v.0)

The creation of the bot was started as part of the study of Go. By now, I've come to realize that I don't like the architecture of the code at all. I am too attached to the framework and build my application around it, I have to adapt to it to implement functionality not intended by the creator of the framework. Let this version be a training field on which I got acquainted with the libraries used. I will try to make the following implementation according to the principles of a clean architecture.

Unfortunately, I was not able to bring the implementation to a working one, but the creation of the bot itself was never the goal of this project. I will continue to work on this project and this repository will be my learning diary
