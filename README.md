# QRbot
This is a repository of a study project created as part of learning the golang programming language.
Just a *telegram bot* that creates a QR according to the text sent to it. It also has special settings for customization.
The QR generator was taken from https://github.com/yeqown/go-qrcode but further modified (https://github.com/1azar/go-qrcode).
